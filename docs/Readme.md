I keep the documentation in index.org, and export to html using emacs. "org"-markdown is similar to github's markdown, but not identical to it.

Ideally, I would like to have github directly interpret and display the org-file.  However:
+ It seems that github does interpret org-mode's format (almost) correctly when used in a readme file, but I don't know how to get it to display on github pages.  
+ I'd like to keep the table of contents on the documentation page, and I don't know how to generate it "directly".

So for the moment Iâ€™ll stick to the write-in-org-and-export-to-html setup.
